# Project on ML
ML Projects

### 📌 Objective
The goal of this project was to **predict medical insurance costs** for individuals based on demographic and lifestyle factors. Accurate prediction models can help insurance companies design fair pricing strategies and assist customers in understanding how personal attributes influence premiums.

### 📊 Dataset
- Typical features include:  
  - **Age** – older individuals generally incur higher costs  
  - **Gender** – sometimes used as a demographic factor  
  - **BMI** – indicator of health risk  
  - **Smoking status** – strong predictor of higher premiums  
  - **Number of children/dependents**  
  - **Region** – geographic differences in healthcare costs  
- **Target variable:** Insurance charges (continuous numerical value)

### ⚙️ Methodology
You applied **six machine learning algorithms** to compare performance. Common choices include:
- **Linear Regression** – baseline model for continuous prediction  
- **Decision Tree Regressor** – captures non-linear relationships  
- **Random Forest Regressor** – ensemble method for improved accuracy  
- **Polynomial Regressor**  
- **Support Vector Regression (SVR)** – handles high-dimensional feature spaces  
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Regression** – instance-based learning  

### 📈 Evaluation
- Models were assessed using metrics such as:  
  - **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**  
  - **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**  
  - **R² Score**  
- Comparative analysis helped identify which algorithm provided the most reliable predictions.

### 🔑 Insights
- **Smoking status and BMI** emerged as the most influential features.  
- Ensemble methods (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) typically outperformed simpler models like Linear Regression.  
- The project highlights how lifestyle choices directly impact insurance pricing.

### 🚀 Applications
- Insurance companies can use such models for **risk assessment and premium calculation**.  
- Customers gain transparency into how their personal data affects costs.  
- Potential integration into **business analytics dashboards** for real-time predictions.


Would you like me to also draft a **comparative results summary** (like a table showing each algorithm’s performance metrics) so you can present it more professionally?
